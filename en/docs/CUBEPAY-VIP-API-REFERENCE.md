# 👑 API Reference — CubePay VIP (Settlement handled by CubePay)

> ✅ **Status:** this module is **deployed and live** on `cubevps.ir`. The full path — buy subscription → VIP token issued → create invoice → customer pays card-to-card → fee deducted → balance released → crypto withdrawal — has been tested end to end with real money. For the architecture and the reasoning behind each design decision, see [`MANAGED-SETTLEMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/MANAGED-SETTLEMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md) (Persian only for now).
>
> This feature ("CubePay VIP", or "special merchants") is entirely **optional and separate** from the existing card-to-card / SMS Forwarder path documented in [`API-REFERENCE.md`](./API-REFERENCE.md) and [`CRYPTO-API-REFERENCE.md`](./CRYPTO-API-REFERENCE.md). It is only for merchants who have bought a VIP subscription; nothing changes and nothing needs migrating for everyone else.

## 🔑 Authentication — the VIP token is separate

CubePay VIP has its **own token**, which is not the same as your normal API token:

| Token | Prefix | Where it comes from | Where it is used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal merchant token | — | your existing token | **only** for `request-activation.php` (you don't have a VIP token yet) |
| VIP token | `vip_` | issued automatically after the subscription payment | every other endpoint in this module |
| VIP sandbox token | `vipsb_` | issued at the same time as the VIP token | Sandbox mode — no real effect |

```
Authorization: Bearer vip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

```
Base URL: https://cubevps.ir/managed-settlement/
```

> 🚫 **The fee wallet plays no part here.** The initial fee-wallet top-up applies only to normal merchants, and none of the VIP endpoints check it.

---

## 🔀 Migrating to VIP: just swap the token

If you already call the **unified router** (`POST /pay/create-order.php`) — that is, you followed the [Foxima](../integrations/faoxima-integration-guide.md), [WordPress](../integrations/wordpress-plugin-guide.md), or [generic integration](../integrations/generic-integration-guide.md) guide — moving to VIP requires **no code changes at all**. Just put the `vip_…` token where the old one was:

```diff
- 'Authorization: Bearer ' . $apiToken        // normal token
+ 'Authorization: Bearer ' . $vipApiToken     // VIP token
```

Same `POST /pay/create-order.php`, same `price_amount`, same `pay_page_url` in the response. The router recognises the token and hands the request to the VIP module:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["POST /pay/create-order.php"] --> B{Token starts with vip_?}
    B -->|No| C["Normal path — card / crypto / chooser page"]
    B -->|Yes| D["VIP module — CubePay treasury card"]
```

| | Normal path | With a VIP token |
|---|---|---|
| URL | `/pay/create-order.php` | same |
| Amount field | `price_amount` (toman) | same (`amount_toman` also accepted) |
| Response | `success`, `method`, `pay_page_url` | same + `invoice_uid` |
| Card shown to the customer | the merchant's own card | the CubePay treasury card |

Small things that do change when you swap the token:

- `order_id` is unique **forever** in VIP (on the normal path it could be reused once the invoice expired).
- The default per-invoice cap is 1,000,000 toman.
- The fee wallet is not checked — the VIP path works even if you never topped it up for the normal path.
- `method` in the response is always `card` (the customer pays card-to-card into the treasury card), so code that already branched on `method` keeps working.

Calling `POST /managed-settlement/api/create-order.php` directly still works and is equally valid for a new integration — the router path exists so that an **existing** integration doesn't have to be touched.

> ⚠️ **If you still use the legacy card-to-card endpoint** (`/smspay/api/create-payment.php`): that path does not recognise VIP tokens and returns an "invalid token" error. For VIP you must change the URL to `POST /pay/create-order.php` and send the amount **in toman** via `price_amount` — the legacy endpoint took the amount in **rial** in an `amount` field, so don't miss that difference. Step-by-step guide: [Migrating to the unified router](./ENDPOINT-MIGRATION.md).

## 💰 Every critical number, in one place

> This is the same table the merchant panel shows under the **"📖 Fees & limits"** tab. The values below are **defaults**; the exact numbers for your own account always come from `GET api/dashboard.php` (an admin can set them per merchant).
>
> 🌐 **Always-up-to-date online version of this table** (covering both normal and VIP merchants, read live from the platform's settings): [cubevps.ir/fees.php](https://cubevps.ir/fees.php) — if a number there differs from this table, the online page wins.

| Item | Default |
|---|---|
| CubePay fee per invoice | **9%** |
| VIP monthly subscription | **799,000 toman / 1 month** |
| Subscription expiry warning | **3 days before** |
| Max amount per invoice | **1,000,000 toman** |
| Daily cap | **10,000,000 toman** |
| Monthly cap | **100,000,000 toman** |
| Minimum withdrawal | **1,000,000 toman** |
| Maximum withdrawal | no cap |
| Balance hold period | **depends on your account — read it from `dashboard.php`** |
| Duplicate guard | **3 similar invoices in 15 minutes** |

> Every one of these can be configured per merchant. If your business is larger, contact support about raising your caps.

> 📌 **How are the daily and monthly caps counted?** They sum your **paid** invoices in that window — not the invoices you created. An expired or cancelled invoice does not count towards the cap, and Sandbox invoices are never counted at all. Your current usage is in `dashboard.php` under `today_paid_toman` and `this_month_paid_toman`.
>
> If the admin has not set a cap specifically for your account, the global default above applies — and if the admin later changes that default, your account follows it immediately. A `null` in the `dashboard.php` response means that cap does not apply to you.

### ⏳ Balance hold period — important

The money from an invoice is not immediately withdrawable. After payment it
first lands in the **"pending"** bucket, and once your account's hold period
has elapsed it moves **automatically** to **"available"**.

Your account's exact value is in the `GET api/dashboard.php` response:

```json
"settlement": {
  "hold_hours": 168,
  "note": "..."
}
```

A `hold_hours` of zero means no hold at all.

📌 **The part that usually causes confusion:** the period is counted **per
invoice**, not once for the whole account. So you only ever wait once — after
that, each day releases the sales of its corresponding day and you have a
continuous daily income stream.

**Why it exists:** your customers pay onto CubePay's cards, and a card-to-card
transfer stays reversible for several days, while our settlement to you is
crypto and irreversible. This gap is exactly the window in which the reversal
risk drops to zero.

### 🎫 VIP eligibility requirements

For `request-activation.php` to accept your request, **both** conditions must
hold:

| Condition | Default |
|---|---|
| Account age | at least **30 days** since your normal account was activated |
| Successful transactions | at least **30 verified transactions** (Sandbox excluded) |

If either fails you get a `403`, and the message states exactly which condition
and how much is still missing. Both numbers are admin-configurable.

### ⚠️ Mismatched deposit amounts

If your customer transfers an amount different from the invoice amount,
automatic settlement does **not** happen and no callback is sent to you — the
system cannot decide on its own which invoice to settle.

In that case you receive an **informational** notification in the bot (order
id, expected amount, deposited amount, difference). The final decision rests
with the CubePay team, and the outcome is reported back to you in the same
place.

If you decide to deliver the order manually, tell support so the deposited
amount (minus the fee) can be credited to your available balance.

> 💡 To avoid this entirely, remind your customers to transfer **exactly** the
> stated amount — even a few toman off stops automatic settlement.

### Network-level withdrawal minimums

On top of the toman limits above, each network has its own minimum. These figures are **approximate** and move with the exchange rate — the real value is fetched from NOWPayments when you submit the request, and anything below it is rejected with a `422`:

| Network | Approximate minimum |
|---|---|
| TON | ≈ 0.12 TON |
| TRX | ≈ 0.74 TRX |
| USDT (TRC20) | ≈ 11.2 USDT |

### What gets deducted from your money?

```
Invoice amount
  − CubePay fee (%, snapshotted at the moment of payment)
  = amount added to your "pending" balance

Withdrawal amount (toman) ÷ locked rate
  − network fee (network only, not CubePay)
  = crypto that arrives in your wallet
```

- CubePay charges **no separate withdrawal fee**; only the network fee is deducted.
- The fee percentage is recorded (snapshotted) **at the moment the invoice is paid** — changing the percentage later has no effect on older invoices.
- The subscription cost is entirely separate and is never taken out of your sales balance.

---

## 1️⃣ Activate and renew the subscription

```
POST /managed-settlement/api/request-activation.php
Authorization: Bearer <your **normal** merchant token>
```

The first, mandatory step. It returns a **NOWPayments crypto payment link**; no VIP token is issued until it is paid.

### ✅ Example response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "invoice_url": "https://nowpayments.io/payment/?iid=1234567890",
  "amount_toman": 1000000,
  "amount_usd": 11.50,
  "months": 1,
  "message": "Open the payment link to activate. Your VIP token is issued automatically once payment clears."
}
```

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| You already have an active subscription | `already_active: true` + `subscription_expires_at` — no new link is created |
| You have an open payment link less than 2 hours old | `reused: true` + the same link — not a fresh duplicate |

The toman price is converted to crypto at the live USD rate. Once the payment is confirmed (via IPN) the profile becomes `active`, `subscription_expires_at` is extended, and the VIP token is sent to you on Telegram.

---

## 🎟 Intake capacity

The number of VIP merchants is **limited**. Because this service involves holding funds in custody, intake is controlled.

When capacity is full, `request-activation.php` responds with `409` and no payment link is created:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "capacity_full": true,
  "message": "CubePay VIP intake is currently full. ..."
}
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Renewal is never blocked** | The cap applies only to **new** merchants. Once you have a profile — even an expired or suspended one — you can always renew |
| **An open payment link reserves a slot** | For up to 2 hours. This stops several people buying the same last remaining slot at once |
| **Paid means served** | If your payment is confirmed, the service is activated regardless. Money is never taken without the service being provided |

> 💡 While capacity is full, the purchase button is hidden in the merchant panel rather than failing on click. A slot frees up when one of the current merchants does not renew.

---

## 🔁 Subscription lifecycle

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| Subscription paid | `vip_` and `vipsb_` tokens are issued, validity extended by `months` |
| 3 days before expiry | a renewal warning is sent (once, `subscription_warned_at`) |
| After expiry | the VIP token stops working for **creating invoices** |
| After expiry | the dashboard, listings, wallet registration and **withdrawals** keep working |

> 💡 The money you earned is yours. Expiry only blocks **new invoices**; your balance is untouched and remains withdrawable whenever you want. `create-order.php` is the only endpoint that requires an active subscription.

---

## 2️⃣ Create an invoice

```
POST /managed-settlement/api/create-order.php
```

The only way to create an invoice in this module — no manual invoices from the panel, the bot, or the admin.

### 📋 Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `order_id` | string | ✅ | your unique order identifier — **unlike the existing card path, reusing an `order_id` is forbidden forever here** (not just while the invoice is open) |
| `amount_toman` | number | ✅ | amount in **toman** — default cap 1,000,000 toman (an admin can change it per merchant) |
| `callback_url` | string | ❌ | where the final result is announced |
| `customer_ref` | string | ❌ | your customer/user identifier — used only to sharpen duplicate detection |

### ✅ Example response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "method": "card",
  "invoice_uid": "b1a2c3d4-...-...-...-000000000000",
  "pay_page_url": "https://cubevps.ir/smspay/pay.php?authority=...",
  "amount_toman": 500000,
  "expires_in_minutes": 60
}
```

### ❌ Important errors

| Message | HTTP Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Invoice amount exceeds the allowed cap | `422` | this merchant's per-transaction cap (the response includes `per_tx_limit_toman`) |
| Daily/monthly settlement cap reached | `422` | the sum of today's / this month's paid invoices has hit the cap |
| This order_id has already been used | `409` | duplicate `order_id` — to change the amount, [cancel the previous invoice first](#3-cancel-an-invoice) |
| Too many similar invoices | `429` | duplicate guard (default: 3 similar invoices in 15 minutes) |
| Invalid VIP token | `401` | you sent the normal token, not the `vip_` one |
| Your CubePay VIP subscription has expired | `403` | comes with `subscription_expired: true` — [renew it](#1-activate-and-renew-the-subscription) |

📌 The amount is **not editable** once the invoice exists — to change it, cancel the old invoice (if still unpaid) and create a new one.

---

## 3️⃣ Cancel an invoice

```
POST /managed-settlement/api/cancel-order.php
```

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `invoice_uid` or `order_id` | string | ✅ (one of the two) | the invoice in question |

Only unpaid invoices can be cancelled. Cancelling does **not** free the `order_id` for reuse (reusing an `order_id` is forbidden forever) — create the new invoice with a new `order_id`.

---

## 4️⃣ Check invoice status

```
GET /managed-settlement/api/check-order-status.php?invoice_uid=...
```
or `?order_id=...`

### `status` values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | not paid yet |
| `paid` | payment confirmed and credited to your balance |
| `expired` | the window closed without payment |
| `canceled` | you cancelled it |
| `held_for_review` | flagged by the duplicate guard — payment and crediting continue normally, it is only marked for admin review |

---

## 5️⃣ List invoices

```
GET /managed-settlement/api/list-invoices.php?page=1&per_page=20&status=paid
```

`status` is optional (one of the values above). The output is paginated (`page`, `per_page`, `total`).

---

## 6️⃣ Register a wallet address

```
POST /managed-settlement/api/register-wallet.php
```

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `currency` | string | ✅ | e.g. `usdttrc20` |
| `network` | string | ✅ | e.g. `TRC20` |
| `address` | string | ✅ | destination wallet address |

Every registration (first time or an address change) starts as `verification_status: "pending"` — until an admin approves it (`verified`) it cannot be used for withdrawals. An already-approved address stays untouched until an admin explicitly disables it.

📬 The review outcome (approved or rejected) is sent to you via the Telegram bot ([@cubepy_bot](https://t.me/cubepy_bot)) — no need to keep polling the dashboard.

---

## 7️⃣ Request a crypto withdrawal

```
POST /managed-settlement/api/request-withdrawal.php
```

**Required header:** `Idempotency-Key: <a unique string from your side>` — if the same request arrives twice with the same key, only one withdrawal is recorded.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wallet_id` | int | ✅ | from the `register-wallet.php` response |
| `amount_toman` | number | ✅ | must be between `min_withdrawal_toman` and `max_withdrawal_toman` (read them from `dashboard.php`) |

### ✅ Example response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "withdrawal_uid": "a1b2c3...",
  "status": "processing",
  "currency": "usdttrc20",
  "rate_locked": 58000.0,
  "crypto_amount_gross": 8.620000,
  "network_fee_crypto": 0.500000,
  "crypto_amount_net": 8.120000,
  "provider_payout_id": "5000123456",
  "note": "The final status is updated via webhook / periodic reconciliation."
}
```

The conversion rate (`rate_locked`) is locked at the exact moment you submit the request. The crypto amount has at most **6 decimal places** (NOWPayments' official limit for payouts).

### Possible `status` values

```
rate_locked → processing → completed          ← success
rate_locked → processing → balance_returned   ← failed, amount returned
rate_locked → failed                          ← never sent, amount returned
```

| Status | Meaning | Effect on your balance |
|---|---|---|
| `rate_locked` | rate locked, not sent yet | "available" → "settling" |
| `processing` | sent to NOWPayments, awaiting confirmation | no change |
| `completed` | crypto reached your address | "settling" → "settled" |
| `failed` | sending to NOWPayments failed | returned to "available" |
| `balance_returned` | sent but rejected by the network | returned to "available" |

Only the raw NOWPayments status `finished` counts as success; `failed`, `rejected`, `rejected_not_checked` and `cancelled` count as failure, and the rest (`new`, `creating`, `waiting`, `processing`, `sending`) are intermediate and never touch your balance.

The amount is returned **exactly once** — never lost, never doubled. If the webhook never arrives, a ten-minute cron job asks NOWPayments for the status directly and applies the same logic, so a withdrawal never sits in `processing` forever.

📬 The final outcome of every withdrawal (crypto delivered, or amount returned to your balance) is also sent to you via the Telegram bot, in addition to the API.

---

## 8️⃣ List / track withdrawal requests

```
GET /managed-settlement/api/list-withdrawals.php?page=1&per_page=20
```

Each row includes `tracking_id` (the NOWPayments reference, or one entered manually by an admin), `status`, and the transparent amounts and fees (`crypto_amount_net`, `network_fee_crypto`, `rate_locked`).

---

## 9️⃣ Dashboard

```
GET /managed-settlement/api/dashboard.php
```

### ✅ Example response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "active",
  "settlement_tier": "vip",
  "payout_frequency": "daily",
  "subscription": {
    "expires_at": "2026-09-03 14:20:00",
    "days_left": 31,
    "is_active": true,
    "fee_toman": 1000000
  },
  "vip_api_token": "vip_a4fd1be3944e...",
  "vip_sandbox_token": "vipsb_7c21ee08b1...",
  "fees": {
    "percent": 9,
    "min_toman": null,
    "max_toman": null,
    "sample_on_100k": 9000,
    "net_on_100k": 91000
  },
  "settlement": {
    "hold_hours": 0,
    "note": "Once the invoice is paid, the amount becomes withdrawable on the next cron run (every 5 minutes)."
  },
  "limits": {
    "per_tx_limit_toman": 1000000,
    "daily_limit_toman": 10000000,
    "monthly_limit_toman": 100000000,
    "min_withdrawal_toman": 500000,
    "max_withdrawal_toman": null
  },
  "today_paid_toman": 2500000,
  "this_month_paid_toman": 18500000,
  "gross_sales_toman": 42000000,
  "total_fee_toman": 4200000,
  "total_settled_toman": 30000000,
  "pending_toman": 1200000,
  "available_toman": 6600000,
  "settling_toman": 0,
  "settled_toman": 30000000
}
```

The four balances (`pending_toman`, `available_toman`, `settling_toman`, `settled_toman`) map exactly onto "pending", "available", "settling" and "settled" as designed in the architecture document.

---

## 🔄 What is sent to your `callback_url` (after an invoice is paid)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "paid",
  "order_id": "ORD123",
  "invoice_uid": "b1a2c3d4-...",
  "amount_toman": 500000,
  "amount": 500000,
  "sig": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
}
```

`amount` is exactly the same value as `amount_toman` — it is sent twice so that code written for the crypto callback (whose field is named `amount`) works with VIP unchanged.

Exactly as on the existing crypto path, rebuild `sig` and compare (HMAC-SHA256 over `order_id|status|amount_toman`) — if it doesn't match, ignore the request.

> 🔑 **The signing key is your VIP token** — the exact `vip_…` token you created the order with (the one in the `Authorization` header). Your normal 64-character token plays no role here; if you rebuild the signature with it, it will never match and you will reject perfectly good payments.

```php
// $vipToken = the same vip_… token you sent in Authorization when creating the order
$expectedSig = hash_hmac('sha256', $orderId . '|paid|' . $amountToman, $vipToken);
if (!hash_equals($expectedSig, $sig)) { exit; }
```

If your server is briefly unreachable, the callback is retried up to 3 times with a delay. On top of relying on the callback, polling `check-order-status.php` periodically is recommended — the same advice as for the existing crypto path.

---

## 🚧 Fully separate from the normal merchants' "3% crypto gateway"

A frequently asked question: normal CubePay merchants already had a crypto withdrawal path with a **3%** fee. Does VIP get mixed up with it? **No.** The two are separate at every layer:

| Layer | The 3% path (normal merchants) | CubePay VIP |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts and records | fully separate | fully separate |
| Fee | 3% | 9% (default; configurable per merchant) |
| Token | normal API token | `vip_` token |
| Fee wallet | required | **never checked** |
| Balance | separate | separate |

The only shared resource is the **NOWPayments account** itself. To stop an admin "withdraw all commission" action from sweeping up balances that belong to VIP merchants, a reserve guard was added: before any bulk withdrawal, the total VIP liability ("pending" + "available" + "settling") is converted to USD, multiplied by a 1.2 safety factor, and withheld from the withdrawable amount.

---

## ⚠️ Important notes

- Every endpoint in this module takes and returns amounts in **toman** (not rial) — unlike the older card endpoints.
- `order_id` values in this module are **completely separate** from those on the existing card/crypto paths — they never collide.
- Settlement is **crypto only**; there is currently no rial withdrawal or card/IBAN registration in this module.
- To test without real effects, use the `vipsb_` token — no real API calls, no ledger entries, and no impact on your real balance or daily cap.
- **Manual** invoice creation is impossible anywhere — not the merchant panel, not the bot, not the admin panel. The only way is `create-order.php` with a VIP token.
- Balances are never edited directly; all four numbers are computed from the **append-only** ledger.
